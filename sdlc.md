##  What is SDLC?

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a structured process used to develop high-quality software in a systematic, cost-effective, and timely manner. It defines a series of steps or phases that guide the software development process from initial requirements to final deployment and maintenance.


##  **SDLC Phases Explained**

### 1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**

* Involves collecting business needs and expectations from stakeholders.
* Conducted by Business Analysts, Product Owners, and Clients.
* Output: Requirements Specification Document (FRD/BRD).

**DevOps Role:**
Not directly involved, but early collaboration with DevOps helps align infrastructure needs and CI/CD planning.


### 2. **System Design**

* Translates requirements into a blueprint (architecture).
* Includes UI/UX design, database schema, infrastructure planning, and technology stack selection.
  

**DevOps Role:**

* Plan infrastructure as code (IaC) using tools like Terraform.
* Decide deployment models (e.g., cloud vs on-prem).
* Design scalable environments with high availability.


### 3. **Implementation / Development**

* Developers write the code based on design specs.
* Code is version-controlled using Git and follows best practices.

**DevOps Role:**

* Set up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
* Containerize applications using Docker.
* Use tools like SonarQube or Trivy for code quality and security scanning.


### 4. **Testing**

* QA team tests the application for bugs, performance, security, and compliance.
* Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and UAT (User Acceptance Testing).

**DevOps Role:**

* Automate test stages in CI/CD.
* Use tools like Selenium, JUnit, or Cypress.
* Deploy test environments using Kubernetes or Docker Compose.


### 5. **Deployment**

* Application is deployed to production after successful testing.
* May involve Blue-Green, Canary, or Rolling deployments.

**DevOps Role:**

* Handle automated and repeatable deployments using Helm, ArgoCD, or Spinnaker.
* Use monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) to track deployment health.
* Rollback in case of failure using GitOps or Helm revisions.


### 6. **Maintenance & Monitoring**

* After release, the software is continuously monitored for issues.
* Updates, patches, and performance tuning are performed as needed.

**DevOps Role:**

* Monitor app and infrastructure with CloudWatch, ELK Stack, or Datadog.
* Set up alerting systems for critical issues.
* Handle on-call support and incident response.


## ðŸ“Š SDLC Models (Popular Variants)

| Model         | Description                                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Waterfall** | Linear and sequential; each phase must complete before moving forward.       |
| **Agile**     | Iterative; continuous development, testing, and feedback.                    |
| **DevOps**    | Integrates development and operations; focuses on automation & collaboration |
| **V-Model**   | Validation and verification are done side-by-side.                           |
| **Spiral**    | Risk-based iterative model for large, complex projects.                      |


In Real time , majority of the project uses Agile with DevOps Approach .


## ðŸš€ How DevOps Enhances SDLC

| SDLC Phase  | DevOps Contribution                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Design      | Infra-as-code, container strategy    |
| Development | Automated builds, version control    |
| Testing     | CI-integrated testing                |
| Deployment  | CD pipelines, rollback, GitOps       |
| Maintenance | Monitoring, logging, on-call support |


##  Real-Time Example

Imagine you're building an e-commerce website:

* **Requirement:** Business wants users to log in, search, and pay online.
* **Design:** Frontend in React, backend in Node.js, hosted on AWS.
* **Development:** Developers write code, push to GitHub.
* **Testing:** Jenkins runs automated tests.
* **Deployment:** Helm deploys app to EKS; ArgoCD handles GitOps.
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus tracks CPU/memory, alerts go to Slack.
