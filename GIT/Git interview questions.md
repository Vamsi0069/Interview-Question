#### 1.What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.

#### 2.What makes Git a Distributed Version Control System?

Git allows developers to work locally with full version history, then push changes to a remote repository like GitHub.

#### 3.Compare Git and SVN.

Git is distributed and allows offline work; SVN is centralized and requires internet connectivity.

#### 4.What is a Git repository?

Itâ€™s a storage space where Git tracks and saves all changes made to project files.

#### 5.How to initialize a Git repository?

git init initializes a new Git repository.

#### 6.What is a bare repository?

A Git repo without a working directory, typically used as a central shared repository.
```
git init --bare myproject.git
```
 -  This way, the bare repository acts like a GitHub or GitLab repository, but hosted in-house.

 -  Since the repo is not meant for editing or working in, having a working directory is unnecessary.
   
 -  It avoids confusion or merge conflicts caused by someone accidentally editing files in a shared repo. 

#### 7.How do you configure Git user details globally?
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
```
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```
#### 8.How to create aliases for Git commands?

git config --global alias.co checkout makes git co work as git checkout.

#### 9.What does git clone do?

Downloads an entire remote repository to your local machine.

#### 10.What is the purpose of git add?

Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.

#### 11.What is the staging area in Git?

An intermediate area to review and format commits before finalizing them.

#### 12.How to commit with both add and message in one step?
```
git commit -a -m "message"
```
#### 13.How to edit a commit message?
```
git commit --amend -m "New message"
```
#### 14.How to undo a commit but keep the changes staged?
```
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
#### 15.How to remove a file from staging area?
```
git reset HEAD <filename>
```
#### 16.Difference between --soft, --mixed, and --hard reset?

â€¢	Soft: resets to commit, keeps changes staged

â€¢	Mixed: resets and unstages changes

â€¢	Hard: resets and discards changes

#### 17.What is HEAD in Git?

A pointer to the current branch reference.

#### 18.What is the purpose of .gitignore?

To exclude files from being tracked by Git.

#### 19.How to view the commit history?

git log

git log --oneline

git log --author="user"

#### 20.How to compare two commits?
```
git diff commit1 commit2
```
#### 21.How to recover a deleted file?
```
git checkout -- <filename>
```
-  Note : It discards local changes in a file

#### 22.How to create and switch to a new branch?
```
git checkout -b new_branch
```
#### 23.How to rename a branch?
```
git branch -m old_name new_name
```
#### 24.How to delete local and remote branches?

â€¢	Local: git branch -d branch_name

â€¢	Remote: git push origin --delete branch_name

#### 25.How to see all local and remote branches?
```

git branch -a
```
#### 26.Difference between git fetch and git pull?

##### git fetch

- Downloads commits, files, and references from the remote repository into your local repository, but does not merge them into your working directory.

- Safe to use because it doesn't change your working files.

- Ideal when you want to see what others have changed before integrating it into your code.

 ##### git pull
 
- It is essentially: git fetch + git merge

- It fetches changes from the remote and then automatically merges them into your current branch.

- Can cause merge conflicts if your local changes conflict with remote ones.


#### 27.How to fetch a remote branch without merging?
```bash
git fetch origin branch_name
```
This will fetch the branch from the remote origin but wonâ€™t merge or checkout it.

### 27. How to fetch a remote branch without merging? 

Use the `git fetch` command. It downloads the branch from the remote without merging it into your current branch.

###  Command:

```bash
git fetch origin <branch-name>
```

This only fetches the branch. To view or switch to it:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

###  Example:

```bash
git fetch origin feature/login
git checkout feature/login
```

###  Use Case :

You want to review a teammateâ€™s branch before merging. So you fetch it first, check it out, test the code, and then decide whether to merge.


#### 28.How to merge a branch?

Be in the target branch, then: git merge source_branch

#### 29.What causes a Git merge conflict?

When changes in the same line/file differ across merged branches.

#### 30.How to resolve merge conflicts?

Edit the file manually, then git add and git commit.

#### 31.How to abort a merge conflict?
```bash
git merge --abort
```
#### 32.What does git rm do?

`git rm` is used to remove files from the working directory and the staging area (index) in Git.

```bash
git rm <file>
```

* Deletes the file from your local project.
* Stages the deletion for the next commit.

#### 33.	How to check which branches have been merged into main?
```bash
git branch --merged
```

| Command               | Purpose                                                     |
|  | -- |
| `git branch`          | Lists all local branches                                |
| `git branch --merged` | Lists local branches already merged into current branch |



###  Example:

```bash
$ git branch
* main
  feature/login
  feature/signup
```

```bash
$ git branch --merged
* main
  feature/login
```

This means:

* `feature/login` is already merged into `main`
* `feature/signup` is not merged yet


###  Use Case:

* Use `git branch` to see all branches
* Use `git branch --merged` to safely delete merged branches


#### 34.Describe Git branching strategy you've used.

Feature, Task, and Release branching (explain with real project use).

#### 35.What is Git stash and when do you use it?

Temporarily stores changes not ready to commit. Useful when switching branches mid-work.

#### 36.Commands related to Git stash:

â€¢	Save: git stash save "msg"

â€¢	Apply: git stash apply stash@{0}

â€¢	Pop: git stash pop

â€¢	List: git stash list

#### 37.How is git rebase different from git merge?

â€¢	Merge:  

      - Preserves full history with a merge commit 
      
      - Combine two branches, keeping both histories 
      
      - Collaborative work, preserves all contributions

â€¢	Rebase:  

      - Move (replay /rebase ) your changes onto another branch 
      
      - re-applies commits in a linear fashion; cleaner history 
      
      - Rewrites history â€“ dangerous if used on public/shared branches

        
#### 38.	How to revert a commit?
```bash
git revert <commit_id>
```
#### 39.How to change the remote URL?
```bash
git remote set-url origin <new_url>
```
#### 40.What is a pull request (PR)?

A request to merge changes from one branch to another, usually with a code review.

#### 41.What is a fast-forward merge?

A merge where the target branch pointer is simply moved forward to the latest commit.

A fast-forward merge happens when the branch being merged is directly ahead of the current branch, with no diverging commits.

In this case, Git simply moves the branch pointer forward â€” no new merge commit is created.


### Example:

```bash
main:    A---B
feature:     \---C---D
```

If `main` hasnâ€™t changed since `B`, merging `feature` results in:

```bash
main:    A---B---C---D
```

Command:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature
```

If it's a fast-forward, no merge commit will be created.

### Use Case:

* No changes have been made on the target branch (e.g., `main`)
* You want a clean, linear history


#### 42.How to force push changes?
```bash
git push origin branch_name --force
```
#### 43.How to tag a specific commit?
```
git tag v1.0 <commit_id>

Push tags: git push origin v1.0
```
#### 44.Difference between annotated and lightweight tags?

### âœ… Q44. Difference between Annotated and Lightweight Tags in Git

Git supports two types of tags: Annotated and Lightweight. Here's a detailed comparison:


### 1. Annotated Tag

* Stored as a full Git object.
* Contains:

  * Tag name
  * Tagger name, email, and date
  * Commit hash
  * Optional message
  * GPG signature (optional)
* Good for releases and official versioning.

Create:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
```

### 2. Lightweight Tag

* Just a pointer to a commit (like a branch).
* No metadata (no message, date, or tagger info).
* Useful for temporary bookmarks or internal use.

Create:

```bash
git tag v1.0
```

#### 45.How to list and delete tags?

â€¢	List: git tag

â€¢	Delete: git tag -d tagname

#### 46.What is a detached HEAD state?

A detached HEAD state occurs when `HEAD` points directly to a commit, tag, or remote branch â€” not to a local branch.

In this state, you're not working on any branch, so new commits won't be associated with a branch unless you create one.


###  Example:

```bash
git checkout 7e3a2f5
```

This checks out a specific commit â€” not a branch. Now you're in a detached HEAD state.

### ðŸ”¹ What happens here:

* You can view or test an old version of the code.
* You can make changes and commit, but those commits are not attached to any branch.
* If you switch branches or exit, your work may be lost.


### ðŸ”¹ How to Save Work in Detached HEAD:

If you've made commits and want to keep them:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

This moves the commits onto a new branch so they won't be lost.


### ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Use Case:

Scenario:
You're debugging a bug introduced in a recent release. You check out a commit from an earlier working state:

```bash
git checkout abc1234
```

You're now in a detached HEAD state and can test code at that commit.


#### 47.How to cherry-pick a commit from another branch?
```
git cherry-pick <commit_id>
```
#### 48.How to rebase interactively?

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

This command lets you interactively edit, squash, reword, or reorder the last `n` commits.

###  Real-Time Use Case:

Scenario:
Youâ€™ve made 5 messy commits while working on a feature (`fix typo`, `update function`, `add logging`, etc.), and now before pushing, you want to clean up the history into meaningful commits.

### Steps to Rebase Interactively:

1. Rebase the last 5 commits:

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~5
   ```

2. In the interactive editor, you'll see:

   ```
   pick 123abc add logging
   pick 456def update function
   pick 789ghi fix typo
   pick abc123 refactor logic
   pick def456 add comments
   ```

3. Change `pick` to:

   * `squash` (combine into the commit above),
   * `reword` (edit commit message),
   * `drop` (remove the commit), etc.

   Example:

   ```
   pick 123abc add logging
   squash 456def update function
   reword 789ghi fix typo
   ```

4. Save and follow the prompts to edit commit messages.

###  Benefit:

Cleans up commit history before merge or push, making it easier to read, review, and debug.

Let me know if you want a sample repo to practice or automate this in a script.


```
git rebase -i HEAD~n to squash/reword commits.
```


#### 49.How do you lock a branch in GitHub?

In repository settings â†’ Branches â†’ Add branch protection rules.

#### 50.How to grant access to a GitHub repository?

Go to Settings â†’ Collaborators â†’ Invite user by GitHub username.

#### 51.what is the difference between git revert and git reset?

##### git revert

- Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous commit.

- Does NOT remove any commit from history.

- Safe to use in shared/public branches (like main or develop), because it preserves history.

##### git reset

- Moves the HEAD and optionally updates the working directory and staging area.

- Can be destructive (especially with --hard), because it removes commits from history.

- Typically used in private branches or local development.

Common options:

git reset --soft <commit>: Keeps changes staged

git reset --mixed <commit> (default): Keeps changes in working directory

git reset --hard <commit>: Discards all changes



#### 52.What are the steps to push your code to a central repo (e.g., GitHub)?

Answer: git init #### Initialize local repo

git add . #### Stage changes

git commit -m "message" #### Commit changes

git remote add origin #### Link to central repo

git push -u origin main #### Push code

#### 53. git push vs git pull ?

 git push

- You use it to share your code with others.

- Only works if your local branch is ahead of the remote.

Example:

git push origin main â€“ pushes your local main to the remote origin.

 git pull

- Combines git fetch + git merge.

- It brings in changes from the remote repository into your current branch.

Example:

git pull origin main â€“ fetches and merges changes from origin/main.

#### 54. GitHub vs Bitbucket ?

GitHub

- A popular platform for hosting Git repositories, especially used for open-source projects.

- Owned by Microsoft and widely adopted by individual developers and the open-source community.

- Strong features like GitHub Actions, Copilot, and seamless integration with VS Code.

Bitbucket

- A Git repository hosting service designed for teams and enterprises.

- Owned by Atlassian, and integrates deeply with Jira, Trello, and Confluence.

- Offers Bitbucket Pipelines for built-in CI/CD, great for managing private team projects.

#### 55. You have code on your local machine and have pushed it to a remote repository. Now you want to push the same code to a different (new) remote repository. How can you change the remote URL?

To change the remote repository URL

Check current remote URL:

```
git remote -v
```
Change the remote URL to the new repository:

```
git remote set-url origin <new-repo-url>
```
Replace <new-repo-url> with the URL of the new Git repository (e.g., from GitHub or Bitbucket).

```
git push origin main

```
(Use main or whatever your branch name is.)

```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/new-repo.git
git push origin main
````

#### 56. If developer want to mirror a repo from 'A' location to 'B' location we use below commands?

git push --mirror <git_URL>
