#### Screening call : Competency based 


### 1. What skills do you have in terms of your experience?
I have hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure, primarily on AWS. I’ve worked on setting up and managing VPCs, EC2 instances, Auto Scaling, IAM roles, S3, RDS, and other core services. I’m also comfortable with automation using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Git. Additionally, I’ve used Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration, and I’m familiar with monitoring tools like CloudWatch and Prometheus. I also follow best practices for security, availability, and cost optimization.


### 2. How will you tackle a situation when you made a mistake at work?
If I make a mistake, my first step is to take ownership and communicate it to the team or lead without delay. Then, I analyze what went wrong, fix the issue immediately if possible, and document the root cause to prevent it from happening again. For example, if I push a faulty script that causes deployment failure, I’d roll back, correct it, and improve the validation process to catch such issues earlier.


### 3. What will you do if you do not know about a tool and how to use it?
If I come across a tool I haven't used before, I start by understanding its official documentation and basic use cases. I also look at tutorials, community discussions, and examples. I believe in learning by doing, so I try it out in a test environment to get comfortable. I'm a quick learner and have picked up tools like Terraform and Prometheus the same way in the past.


### 4. Are you comfortable working on-call? Will that be a problem?
Yes, I’m comfortable working on-call. I understand that production issues or system outages may not always occur during work hours, and I’m okay with supporting critical situations when needed. I believe being on-call is part of owning the system reliability and customer experience.


### 5. What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Strengths:

* Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work under pressure.
* Quick learner when it comes to new tools or technologies.
* Good at automation and improving efficiency in repeated tasks.
* Clear communication and coordination with team members.
  
Weaknesses:

* Earlier in my career, I used to try solving everything on my own before asking for help. Now, I’ve learned to balance independence with collaboration by reaching out when needed.
* I sometimes tend to over-document processes, but I’ve realized that keeping it concise helps others better.
* Sometimes i over stretch
