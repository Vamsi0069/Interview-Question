##  Project & Communication:

### 1. Agile

A methodology that promotes iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback. Most modern software teams follow some version of Agile (like Scrum or Kanban).



###  2. Jira / Ticket / Issue

* Jira: A popular project management tool used to track work.
* Ticket: Represents a task, bug, or feature (also called an “issue”).
* A typical ticket includes:

  * Title
  * Description
  * Priority (High/Medium/Low)
  * Assignee
  * Status (To Do, In Progress, Done)

Example:
“Hey, please check ticket `ABC-123` on Jira for the login issue.”



###  3. Stand-up (Daily Scrum)

* A short daily meeting (10–15 min).
* Each team member answers 3 questions:

  1. What did I do yesterday?
  2. What will I do today?
  3. Is there any blocker?

Purpose: Transparency and quick sync.



###  4. Backlog

* A list of tasks, bugs, and features yet to be worked on.
* Managed by the Product Owner.
* Ordered by priority.



###  5. Sprint

* A time-boxed period (usually 1 or 2 weeks) where a fixed set of tasks are picked and completed.
* Teams commit to delivering “sprint goals.”

Related:

* Sprint Planning: Deciding what to work on during the sprint.
* Sprint Review: Demo at the end of sprint.
* Sprint Retrospective: Discuss what went well and what can be improved.



###  6. User Story / Task / Sub-task

* User Story: Describes a feature from the user’s perspective.

  > *Example: "As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can recover my account."*
* Task: A technical breakdown of a story.
* Sub-task: A smaller part of a task.



###  7. Epic

* A large user story or a group of related stories.
* Example: An "Authentication Epic" might include:

  * Sign up
  * Login
  * Forgot Password
  * MFA setup



###  8. Blocker / Impediment

* Something that is preventing a task from moving forward.

  > Example: “I can’t continue this task until the database is ready.”



###  9. Kanban

* A visual workflow management system.
* Uses a board with columns (To Do → In Progress → Done).
* Focuses on continuous delivery without fixed sprints.



###  10. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

* Written by Product Managers.
* Describes:

  * The problem
  * Target users
  * Features
  * Goals
  * Metrics

Used to align dev, QA, and business teams.



###  11. Retrospective

* A meeting at the end of a sprint to reflect on:

  * What went well
  * What didn’t
  * How to improve

Promotes continuous improvement.



###  12. ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival)

* Used to communicate when a task or feature is expected to be completed.

  > “What’s the ETA for the backend API?”



###  13. Review / Approval

  * Most tasks go through a code review or QA review process before being marked done.

  * “This ticket is done, waiting for QA approval.”
  * “Please review my PR.”



###  14. Collaboration Tools

* Slack / Microsoft Teams – for real-time messaging
* Confluence / Notion – for documentation and knowledge sharing
* Zoom / Google Meet – for video calls and demos
