Self-Introduction
Hi, I’m "your name". I have around 4 years of experience in the IT industry, with a core focus on DevOps engineering. My experience includes implementing CI/CD pipelines, automating infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible, and managing containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes.

I previously worked at Infosys for over 3 years, where I was part of a central DevOps team supporting multiple microservices-based applications hosted on hybrid infrastructure, including AWS, VMware, and physical servers. I recently joined Synechron as a Senior DevOps Engineer, where I was initially aligned to a BFSI project that got ramped down. Since then, I’ve been actively involved in enhancing my DevOps skillset, especially around GitHub Actions, container orchestration, and cloud-native deployments.

I’m currently looking for a stable opportunity where I can apply my DevOps skills in a hands-on role and contribute to improving the reliability and scalability of systems.
