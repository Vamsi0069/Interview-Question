In my day-to-day responsibilities, I manage a range of DevOps and cloud infrastructure tasks to ensure smooth CI/CD operations and application availability.

My day typically begins with a daily stand-up (scrum call), where the team discusses project progress, blockers, and prioritizes tasks for the day. This helps align efforts and ensures team collaboration.

Post the meeting, I focus on CI/CD pipeline monitoring, particularly using Jenkins. I review the status of builds and deployments. In case of failed builds or pipeline errors, I promptly investigate logs, identify root causes, and implement fixes to restore functionality.

If Jenkins is operating as expected, I shift my focus to Kubernetes (K8s) cluster monitoring. I routinely check the health and performance of nodes and pods using tools like kubectl, Grafana, or Prometheus. If a pod is in a crash loop or pending state, I troubleshoot by examining logs, events, and configurations, applying fixes as needed, and informing the team about the resolution.

I also create and manage Kubernetes manifest files (YAMLs) to define deployments, services, config maps, and other K8s resources. This ensures consistent and scalable deployment of applications across environments.

Additionally, I collaborate closely with our cloud team to handle various AWS tasks. This includes provisioning and managing EBS volumes, S3 buckets, configuring IAM roles and policies, and resolving VPC/subnet-related issues to ensure secure and efficient networking.

Overall, my role is a blend of proactive monitoring, quick issue resolution, infrastructure as code (IaC), and collaboration to maintain a stable and automated environment.
